# BRAIN-TUMOR-PROJECT

Welcome to Brain Tumor Detection project !!!
This project focuses in creating a robust computer based for the early identification and classification of Brain Tumor using MRI scans . 
Our goal is to support medical professionals in making accurate diagnoses, leading to timely treatments and improved patient outcomes.
The main objectives of brain tumor detection are:
ï‚· Early detection: Early detection of brain tumours is crucial to provide timely treatment 
and improve the patient's chances of survival. Brain tumours can be asymptomatic in the 
early stages, and imaging tests can help detect them before symptoms develop.
1) Accurate diagnosis: Accurate diagnosis of brain tumours is essential to determine the 
type, location, and size of the tumour. This information is critical for selecting the most 
appropriate treatment and predicting the patient's prognosis.
2) Treatment planning: Brain tumour detection plays a vital role in treatment planning. 
Accurate imaging can help identify the location of the tumour and guide surgical 
interventions or radiation therapy.
3) Monitoring disease progression: Imaging tests can be used to monitor the growth and 
progression of brain tumours. This information is essential for determining the effectiveness 
of treatment and adjusting the treatment plan as needed
